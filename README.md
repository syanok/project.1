Overview/description of the project:
This website I am submitting for our first course project is an online bakery, called Sugarcookie. The website includes a home page, which is the welcome page for visitors. It is followed by other pages including a special orders page, menu, contact form, a checkout page for purchases, and an about page which provides more detail about the fictional business the site was created for, Sugarcookie. I includes HTML, CSS and Bootstrap code to create the content and styles on each page, with an overall .main tag used to implement uniform font,background color and some styles, to make the pages look cohesive. The contact form is active and was created using Formspree.io to collect submissions. 

Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered: 
To use the Sugarcookie website, users can either start by clicking on pages in the navigation bar, or they can click on three images below the image carousel at the top of the page that will take them to three other subsequent webpages. The only page that leads to an external source is the contact page form which leads to a Formspree.io submission conformation, once the contact form is completed and submitted

Technologies Used ( .html , .css ):
Both HTML and CSS were used to create each of the webpages for this website project.

Ideas for future improvement (minimum of 3): 
1. Implementing JavaScript to make the checkout / shopping cart form active
2. Updating the video carousel on the about page to have it play on a loop from the beginning image
3. Adding static images to the special orders page to make is more visual
